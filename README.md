### <div align="center">ABSTRACT:</div>
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
<div align="center"> As a Tigers baseball fan, I frequently find that most stat applications clog their viewers user experience by introducing an overly abundant amount of stats related to the position player or pitcher in question - motorCityKitties was developed as my personal take on the solution to that problem! By removing under-valued stats and building a purposefully minimal UI, MotorCityKitties offers serious fans a much more streamlined way to view the Detroit Tigers player stats without having to navigate an over-done, cluttered interface.</div>

### <div align="center">CONTEXT:</div>
<div align="center">MotorCityKitties was written by myself during my final week of Module 3 at Turing School of Software and Design. During this period in my development journey, I had been writing in React.js for 6 weeks. I was hoping to use this application in order to further my understanding of writing JavaScript in a React environment, all the while working to further understand the use of TailWind CSS styling on prebuilt UI components.</div>

### <div align="center">BIGGER PICTURE:</div>
<div align="center">Being the MLB nerd that I am, my plan is to introduce a variety of new features to this appliacation as I work towards my first job in tech! For now, the goal is to add a "PlayerStatExpanded" component that allows users to view more in-depth stats surrounding a player on click. After which, I'm hoping to change the homescreen to incorporate a "TeamSelect" component, which will allow fans to view any of the other 29 MLB team stats, just as they can now for the Detroit Tigers.</div>



### <div align="center">LEARNING GOALS:</div>
<div align="center">Moving forward with the application, my highest aim is to keep all components as modular as possible in order to further their reusability as I work towards futurue functionalities. The app, in its initial form, may seem to have a strangely built component structure, but these decisions were intentional in order to set myself up for success later on down the road. I'm hoping to really explore what it means to offer a "simple" user experience with this app, and I'm excited to see where it goes!</div>
